To authorize UPBotDev on a server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=929729299525795951&permissions=1238025235520&scope=bot


If we are added to a new server we need to fill all values of setup or we will miserably fail


------------- Rank thinking --------------------
Number of words for each message
Excluding text from codeblocks
Receiving any kind of emoji, especially on codeblocks
Receiving thanks and appreciations
Use some low exponential grow function

lev = floor(
    1.25 * numword ^ 0.25 + 
    1.5 * numappr ^ 0.27
    1.5 * numthanks ^ 0.27
)

------------- Setup --------------------

Setup Menus to create:
- appreciation (emojis, where is tracked, who can use)
- custom commands (who can define, who can use)
- help pages (who can use)
- emoji for role (who can use, role/post to use/emoji)

Logic to update:
- appreciation
- custom commands
- help pages
- emoji for role
